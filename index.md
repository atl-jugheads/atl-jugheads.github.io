# Project Jupyter

> "Open source, interactive data science and scientific computing across over 40 programming languages"
> > jupyter.org

Project Jupyter is all about bringing todayâ€™s best open source software to anyone that needs to work with data. You can try the Notebook, Jupyter's web-based exploratory computing environment, today through free online services like SageMathCloud[1] and Binder[2].  Or, Jupyter can be easily installed[3] on your personal Linux, OSX or Windows computer. If you support many users, JupyterHub[4] can bring your compute resources and data to your users and groups with a powerful, familiar user experience.
